 * app_cf_brushless_chamber_takeoff_Pcontrol_hybrid.c
 *
 * HYBRID variant. The PCA/RANSAC plane distance is better than the raw zone
 * average when it is available, but log200 showed it often is NOT: during
 * hover the fit succeeded 33-92 % of the time depending on the wall (it is the
 * planarity test that rejects it, not a lack of range data), and below ~10 cm
 * of altitude it fails almost completely because the floor enters the fan and
 * the two surfaces cannot be fitted as one plane.
 *
 * So this build picks the source per phase and per axis:
 *
 *   TAKEOFF : always the zone average. The drone is low, the plane fit is
 *             unusable there, and a ramping height is no time to be losing
 *             the horizontal loop.
 *   HOVER   : per axis. If BOTH walls of an opposing pair have a plane, that
 *             axis uses the plane distances; if either one is missing, that
 *             axis falls back to the zone average for BOTH of its sensors.
 *   LAND    : always the zone average, same reason as takeoff.
 *
 * The "both or neither" rule matters: the plane distance is measured from the
 * BODY ORIGIN while the zone average is measured from the SENSOR, so mixing
 * the two within one axis would inject the mount offset (59.2 mm front/back,
 * 21.7 mm left/right) straight into the centering error.
 *
 * The old measurement, vl53l8cxToFAvg[], is the mean of the 16 (or central 4)
 * zone ranges of one sensor. Three things are wrong with it as a "distance to
 * the wall":
 *   1. Each zone measures along its own slanted ray, so the mean is longer
 *      than the perpendicular distance, and the error grows with tilt.
 *   2. A zone that clips the floor, the ceiling or a corner drags the mean.
 *   3. It is measured from the SENSOR, so opposing pairs sum to
 *      (box - sensor separation), not to the box width. Flight logs showed
 *      front+back ~0.44 m in a 0.50 m chamber for exactly this reason.
 *
 * tofOdometryFitSensorPlane() already solves all three: it converts the 16
 * zones into body-frame points (mount rotation and translation applied), fits
 * a plane with RANSAC + PCA, and returns d = the perpendicular distance from
 * the BODY ORIGIN to that plane. tof_wall_angle.c runs that fit for all six
 * horizontal sensors on every ranging frame anyway, so this app reads the
 * cached result through tofWallAngleGetPlaneDistM() -- no extra computation,
 * and no touching the fitter's static point buffer from the wrong task.
 *
 * chamber.wallSrc selects the source so the two can be compared back to back
 * on the same rig without a reflash.
 *
 * Standalone app-layer mission for the Crazyflie Brushless with a flow
 * deck (plus an optional vl53l8cx multizone ToF deck for logging the
 * chamber walls): sit at the floor centre of a small test chamber, arm,
 * take straight off to a fixed hover height, hold there for a set time,
 * then land back on the same spot -- entirely on-board, no radio commands
 * needed once triggered.
 *
 * Intended geometry: a 50 x 50 x 50 cm chamber, drone placed at the floor
 * centre (chamber coords (25, 25, 0) cm). It takes off to (25, 25, 25) cm
 * -- centre of the box, 25 cm up -- hovers for `hoverTimeS`, then descends
 * back to (25, 25, 0) cm.
 *
 * COORDINATE NOTE: the Crazyflie's estimator has NO absolute origin -- it
 * zeroes its position at the takeoff point. So "(25,25,25) cm" is realised
 * as "0.25 m straight up from the takeoff point, holding that x/y".
 * Placing the drone at the chamber floor centre aligns the estimator frame
 * with the chamber frame. Landing holds the captured takeoff x/y; TAKEOFF
 * and HOVER both servo to the middle of the box using the four wall
 * distances (see wallCenterVel below). Nothing here servos to an absolute
 * (25,25) -- there is no external reference for that.
 *
 * DIFFERENCE FROM app_cf_brushless_chamber: that app flies the takeoff ramp
 * as a fixed-x/y absolute setpoint and only starts the wall-centering P
 * control once HOVER begins. This variant runs the SAME centering control
 * during the takeoff ramp as well, so the drone is being pulled towards the
 * middle of the chamber from the moment it leaves the floor. Only the z
 * setpoint differs between the two phases (ramped a*takeoffHeight during
 * takeoff, constant takeoffHeight during hover). Set param
 * `chamber.tkoffPctl` = 0 to fall back to the original fixed-x/y takeoff.
 *
 * This is app_cf_brushless_slam_tunnel.c with the forward-tunnel "advance"
 * phase replaced by a fixed-point hover; the arming/takeoff/landing/
 * logging/trigger scaffolding is unchanged -- see that file (and
 * app_cf_brushless_hover_move.c) for detail on those parts. Brushless
 * motors require explicit arming before they spin; this app requests it
 * and waits for it to succeed before takeoff, and disarms after landing.
 *
 * Ranges must NEVER be read over a live radio LogConfig for the vl53l8cx
 * deck (watchdog-reboot risk) -- this app only touches the up sensor via
 * logGetFloat() (reads the live firmware log table directly, not radio)
 * for its hand trigger, and the uSD logger records the full fan.
 *
 * Trigger: set param `chamber.start` = 1 (radio/USB), or hold a hand
 * within `chamber.handMm` of the up-facing sensor (vl53l8cx.s8) for
 * `chamber.handHoldMs`.
 *
 * uSD-card logging: TWO logical streams in one file (fixedFrequency = the
 * 9 vl53l8cx ranges; pose = position/attitude, triggered once per loop
 * below), decoded into two CSVs by sd_log_to_csv.py. Both gated by
 * `usd.logging`, turned on at takeoff and off at landing. See
 * sdcard/config.txt.
